when you nudge the inputs in the direction of the gradients we expect a less negative output...

dL/db = (dL/da) * ( db/da)
if a car goes 4 times as fast as a bike and a bike is twice as fast a runner, the car is 8times faster than a runner
4*2

activtion functions is applied to the dot products of the weights and inputs
weights are the synaptic strengths of the neuron

we're back propagating wrt the accuracy and trying to minimize that

a plus sign is a distributor of gradient, the gradient flows to each + input because the local derivative is =1

create bigrams, 2 characters in a row, next character only cares about previous character..
want to add special characters to each name so that the first and last letters are known

create unique but name sounding word

bigram character level language model


xenc is made up of 1 hot vectors

we currently have probabilities as the outputs... 27 numbers are possible and they are all very low %s (0.02, 0.001, etc)
the likelihood is a product of all the probabilities (really small number) (probability of the entire data set assigned by the model trained)
log grows more an more negative as it approaches 0 and if you pass in 1 you get 0.


a*b*c
log(a*b*c) = log(a)+log(b)+log(c)

A = [3, 1, 4]
B = [[4,3],[2,5],[6,8]]
A=1x3
B=2,3
# of columns in 1st matrix has to equal number of rows in second.


[32,6] * [6,100] = [32,100] **THE 6s MATCH SO WE CAN MULTIPLY**

create openai chrome extension to: write an email, reply to an email

todo:
deploy a flask app to a linux server, flask stuff with pp.net

-get API key, store in local storage

-make copy function work
-give 2 Ai icons (professionalize, respond with yes or no)
-get highlighted text from content script as selected text.


TO DO:
-copy to clipboard.

-need to set functionality on 2nd button.
***what we could do have 2 functionalities in popup, and gmail functionality. (document.activeElement)
(popup)
TLDR
Q&
(in browser) (g_editable) OR contenteditable="true"//keydown is fired on the element that can receieve keyboard input
Professionalize.

new web accesible resource - put js file, you can load a myfile.js as if it was loaded from the webpage.
---integrate video API



To do:
neural network from scratch??
integrate youtube video into gradio

3js code in a react fashion?

TO DO:
website
--change sections around? look for more tech to add - figure out the side block

update thera.py 
--build front end?
--pole D-ID GET request until result_url available (chat gpt has the code)

next projects?
-uniswap info page for diff pairings (websockets??)/flask backend?/nodeJS/graphQL/
-for perhaps python websocket trading bot?
-some sort of rust microservice? crypto payments?
-kotlin app.
-LEET CODING
-websocket chats
-proof of concept: custom chatGPT - for internal docs/podcasts/videos/etc
2880x2048 for project pictures.

-traffic monitoring flow/accidnets/construction
